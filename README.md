### What I learned

This challenge improved my understanding of the ReactJS Framework and Library. In this challenge, I'll learn about react components, hooks, how to use assets in a react project, and finally, how react manages a one-page full website, which is react's main feature.
And in this project, I'm learning Reactjs' Api and CRUD operations, as well as the JSON server and JSON database. The finest part of this learning phase is learning how to use the db.jason file to learn api ho intrect. This helps me to improve my ideas.
